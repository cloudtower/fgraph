# FGraph

Have you ever struggled to explain to someone who your friends are? Is your response mostly "well, I know this guy from this other guy, with whose friend I used to work with..."?
Say no more, here comes a nice way to draw and explain your friends as a graph!

## Installation and Execution

You need `Python 3.X` and Pythons webserver `Flask` (`pip3 install flask`).
Simply run `python3 server.py --port [port of your choosing]` and look at the interface in your browser!

## Interface

The interface features three modes. One were you can add, edit and delete nodes and links, while adding links by dragging lines between the nodes.
The second mode freezes the forces in the graph and lets you drag the nodes freely. You can even export your result as an svg picture!
There is also a third mode where you can simply explore your graph.
